# FlightManagementSystem
This is a console-based application built with Python and SQLite to simulate a basic flight management system. 
It allows users to manage flights, pilots, and destinations through various operations such as adding, updating, assigning pilots, and viewing summaries. 
The system supports SQL INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and complex JOIN queries through user-friendly menu options.

To run the system, simply execute main.py. When launched for the first time, the database will be empty. 
You can choose from the menu to add flights manually or use Option 17 to insert sample data. 
This gives you flexibility to either start from scratch or load predefined data for testing and demonstration.
